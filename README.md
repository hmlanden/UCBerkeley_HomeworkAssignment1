# UCBerkeley_HomeworkAssignment1

Homework assignment for Data Analytics Bootcamp.

Please note: I got slightly different values in the bonus section. I think this has to do with how we chose to handle the cutoff points for each section. It looks like perhaps, in the example for the assignment, that there may have been some missing greater/less than or EQUAL to in the equations used. I double-checked my counts against the total in the file, looks solid.
